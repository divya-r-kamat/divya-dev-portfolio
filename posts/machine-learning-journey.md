# AI/ML Journey – The Beginning…

I have been trying to write a blog for a long time now. Every time I start, type a few words and then STOP.

Today, I made up my mind and finally decided to write a blog…

This is my first blog, let me give a little background about me –  I am a Computer Science graduate. Like any other students graduating with a undergraduate degree, I was placed in one of the top Indian multinational company in 2007. I was very excited to be placed and working in a IT Sector. I was being trained in DOTNET and post that, like any other Software Engineer I was deployed to a Data Warehousing (ETL) project – a completely different technology from which I was trained on!!!

I was fortunate that Data Warehousing and ETL turned out to be my area of interest, I had a great learning path and exceptional growth. I have been working in this field since then. After 12 years in this field, I was looking to take a next logical step in my career by learning some new technology which could take me to next level!!

At the same time, we had a Digital competency group created in our organization mainly working towards AI/ML/DS skills (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning / Data Science)  and they were looking for volunteers to support this initiative. Since the buzz word then was Machine learning! I thought this was a right opportunity for me to get into this field, so I expressed my interest to be involved in the initiative!

That is when, I started to explore and develop the necessary skills required to make the transition – and My Journey of Python and Machine learning Started!

I intend to write blogs to share my learnings and communicate my thoughts and experience in my AI/ML Journey
